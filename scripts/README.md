# Scripts to set up a development environment

The scripts in this folder are intended to help set up a development environment suitable for use with this project.

For more information see the comments near the top of each script.

Most (if not all) of these scripts will be used by vagrant to set up a development virtual machine. See the Vagrantfile for more information.
